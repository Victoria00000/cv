        I currently have about 1 year in the world of frontend development. I am an active and
        proactive person, I have ambition and curiosity, and I like to be in continuous progress. I am
        patient and communicative. I hope to be part of a team that allows me to grow up as a
        professional, but also to contribute to mutual growth.
        Today I want to perfect myself in frontend development and the study of the English
        language. Also, I want to enter the backend world to become a fullstack developer.
